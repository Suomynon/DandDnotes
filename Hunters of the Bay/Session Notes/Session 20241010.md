As we leave the [[Temple of Chauntea]] we go to [[Woodworthy Manor]] and pass a lot of food shops
A street sign points us to [[Woodworthy Manor]].
There are also a couple of other shops and the [[Temple of Lyra]] and [[Temple of Selune]]
We pass a couple of people building a stage for jousting

As we arrive at [[Woodworthy Manor]] we see a big gate around it and a sending stone on a pole next to the gate.
We enter the manor after using the sending stone to tell them we have arrived. (They sent us a note because they want to hire us)

[[Allaric Strange]] tries to use the knocker on the door but the door swings open before he gets to use it.

The servant (who is a goblin) instantly sees that [[Sheshka]] is a goblin and complains because the was taught that goblins are filthy creatures and should not be in the big house (inside).

The servant ([[Gremlin]]) leads us to the room where [[John Wilks]] is and he introduces himself and asks if we want some tea.
He apologizes about his servants behavior.

He tells us that he called us here because of the strange things going on with the crops and the scarecrows.

He tells us that he thinks it's definitely [[Mayor Ramsay]] that's causing it.
His family traded a little linnen but they were trying to be competitors to the ranching and agriculture business but was put out of business by the Wilks family.

He wants the crops to stop dying.
He wants the scarecrows to stop attacking people.
And he wants the mayor to stop being active.
He will give us 4000 gold pieces for solving the case.
[[Allaric Strange]] persuaded him to make it 5500 as long as we can make sure that we find out that [[Mayor Ramsay]] was behind all of this.

[[Sheshka]] goes outside and wants to see what kind of crops he has in his garden.
He has corn in all of his crop-fields. And has quite some "vegetables" in his garden.

[[Sheshka]] finds [[Gremlin]] outside who is crying because he thinks he will be punished by his master.
He tells her that his master told him that he will be beaten head to toe if he ever steps out of line.
He never heard of a sherif and was not beaten by his master when the sherif was around.
[[George Wilks]] (Father of [[John Wilks]]) used to be his master but is dead now.
He also told us that of all the crops that died none of [[John Wilks]]'s crops died.
[[Sheshka]] sees a lot of goblins working on the estate. All of them are wearing brass collars.
One of the links of the collars contains a red gem that looks fairly magical.
After using detect magic she finds out that the gem is magical and contains evocation magic.
The fence contains a slight divination magic.
Some of the statues (the statues of family members) around the grounds appear to also be magical (enchantment magic)
[[Gremlin]] says that his room looks out on the southern grounds (from the workers house)
[[Sheshka]] gave Gremlin a lamp and coated it in purple so that purple light will come from it.

[[Sheshka]] goes back to the manor as [[Kalani]] and [[Allaric Strange]] come out.
They leave the property and [[Sheshka]] tells them everything she learned. They go investigate his crops.

[[Kalani]] finds a scarecrow that stands there and looks a bit down.
After looking away and looking back the head is slightly raised.
[[Kalani]] screams "Guys! This one moved!"

[[Allaric Strange]] finds a scarecrow that has his hands tucked behind his back.  The scarecrow is a little fat. Has a bushy mustache made from straw and there is not that much out of the ordinary about it. As I looked to where [[Kalani]]'s scream came from and back to the scarecrow the scarecrow is now looking down with his hands beside it.
[[Allaric Strange]] ties the hand of the scarecrow behind its back and feels the hands of the scarecrow gently graze his hands. 

It is very quiet in this field.
It appears that the sounds of the screams keeps coming from other parts.
[[Sheshka]] uses string to find her way through the field. [[Sheshka]] follows the string back and finds [[Kalani]] who is surrounded by 3 scarecrows
[[Allaric Strange]] trips over the string and follows it to the others to help fight the scarecrows.
After defeating the scarecrows [[Kalani]] heals himself and [[Allaric Strange]] a bit.
