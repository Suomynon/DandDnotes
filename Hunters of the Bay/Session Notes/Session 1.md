Took a long rest in [[The Old Chipmunk]]
Woke up and ate breakfast
Got locations of [[Woodworthy Manor]], [[Great Hurdiny's magical Emporium of illusionism]] and [[Temple of Chauntea]] from the innkeeper
On the way to the [[Great Hurdiny's magical Emporium of illusionism]] we see a couple of street perfomers: A couple of jugglers, a black Kenku mime.
We entered the [[Great Hurdiny's magical Emporium of illusionism]]
[[Sheshka]] casted a spell to detect the magic items in the store.
1 is a whoopy cushion
[[Sheshka]] finds a ring in a bin and puts it on
It appears to be a ring of minor illusion
In a glass cabinet we see a bunch of jewellery.
The centerpiece of the cabinet is a gold necklace with 5 red gems. It appears to be a necklace of fireballs
Red candy that makes it look like you're bleeding from your mouth
Stink bombs 
80 [[Dehydrated Pigeons]]  for 3 silver a piece
Candy that gives you a bad breath

After we rung the bell on the counter [[Hurdiny]] came up from a hatch in the floor in a grand entrance and showed us how to use the [[Dehydrated Pigeons]]

Hurdiny will think about how the scarecrows might be coming to life
He told us to come back tonight to give him a little time to think about it.

After we went to the [[Temple of Chauntea]] to meet up with [[Arae O'Brian]] to talk a little bit about the festival that takes place tomorrow.

[[Kalani]] tells [[Arae O'Brian]] about the rituals they have at their island
They agreed to meet up an hour before dawn on the 29th of Libra.

We left the [[Temple of Chauntea]] and started going to [[Woodworthy Manor]]
