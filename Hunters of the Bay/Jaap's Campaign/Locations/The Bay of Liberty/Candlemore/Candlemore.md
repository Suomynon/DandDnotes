### Description
Surrounded by golden corn fields. Parts look like they withered and died.
You can hear music coming from the town
There are lots of travellers coming to the town because there will be a festival taking place on the 29th of Libra.
There are a lot of pretty intricated scarecrows on the fields. These scarecrows are not magic and do not have any mechanical things to make them move, but they can move.

There are tracks from the scarecrow going into the cornfield and they left a note with a middle finger.

In the town there are a lot of food and drink stands selling different foodstuffs and drinks for the festival.
